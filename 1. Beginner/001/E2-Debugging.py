# Exercise 2 - Debugging Practice
"""
Instructions:
Look at the code.
There are errors in all the lines of code.
Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

Example Output:
When you run your program, it should print the following:
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
"""

# Given Code 
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Exercise 2 - Solution
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
