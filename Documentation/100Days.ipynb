    "#### Notes\n",
    "- Single and double quotes\n",
    "    - Python doesnâ€™t make any difference between single and double quotes\n",
    "    - Mostly a matter of personal preference\n",
    "    - Most common convention is to use single quotes for string literals and reserve double quotes for strings that contain single quotes\n",
    "- Spaces are important\n",
    "    - Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "- A variable...\n",
    "    - doesn't need to be declared\n",
    "    - is case sensitive\n",
    "    - name must start with a letter or the underscore\n",
    "    - name with multiple words is best separated by a underscore\n"
