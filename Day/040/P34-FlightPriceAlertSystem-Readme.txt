Flight Price Alert System - README

This program is a Flight Price Alert System that helps users find low-priced flights from a specific origin city to
various destinations. It utilizes flight search APIs, manages customer data, and sends notifications via SMS and email
when a flight price drops below a certain threshold.

Usage:
1. Set up the necessary API credentials and configuration parameters.
2. Run the program to retrieve destination data and check for low-priced flights.
3. If a flight's price is lower than the predefined threshold, customers will receive notifications via SMS and email.


IMPORTANT:
Hey there, while this Flight Price Alert System is here to provide some flight-searching fun, please remember not to
take it too seriously! It's like using a rubber duck for flyingâ€”it might make you laugh, but it won't actually get you
off the ground! For real flight bookings, rely on trusted travel platforms and not on my code.



Happy coding, and safe travels!
